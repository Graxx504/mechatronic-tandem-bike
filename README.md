# Mechatronic-Tandem-Bike

## H-PEV

### **Problem Statement:** 
Current public transportation is environmentally hazardous and vastly inefficient due to poor vehicle maintenance of diesel/petrol based solutions or electric solutions that utilize conventional fossil fuel produced power. [^1]

### **Project Proposal**
To replace conventional short distance public transportation with a Human Powered Electric Vehicle (HPEV) carbon-neutral alternative. We will achieve this in the following manner:
Harvesting user generated energy through an electric generator and foot actuated chain-sprocket mechanism (similar to a bicycle pedaling system)
Powering an electric motor using this harvested energy and transferring it to the wheel using shafts/axles.
(Optional) Using overhead solar cells as a secondary energy reserve.
